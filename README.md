# Slay the Spire Googly Eyes mod

Makes the game infinitely better.

## Googly eyes for modded content ##

Mod authors can add googly eyes to their own cards, relics, creatures and events.

To edit the googly eyes, enable debug mode (using Basemod's `debug true` command). Then
* Click on the image to add a googly eye.
* Drag to move,
* right click to remove an eye,
* and hold shift to resize.

Cards and relic googly eyes can be edited in the library.
Creature and event googly eyes can be edited in debug mode while playing the game.

Editing the googly eyes creates a file `googly-eye-locations.json` in the Slay the Spire directory.
You can include this file in your own mod's resources (next to ModTheSpire.json).

Please submit changes to the googly-eye-locations for the base game by creating a github issue.
