# Slay the Spire Googly mod

Makes the game infinitely better.

## Improving custom cards ##

In the card library, enable debug mode (using Basemod's `debug true` command). Then click on the image. Drag to move, right click to remove, and hold shift to resize.
This creates a file `eye-locations.json`. Please submit this file by creating a github issue. I will accept locations for all modded content.
